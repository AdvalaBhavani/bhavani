            <center><h2>Css</h2></center>
            <p>Line clamping, or multi-line truncation limits the number of visible lines of text in a block while truncating any additional text that exceeds the specified number of lines. This is useful for maintaining clean layouts and ensuring that excessive text doesn't disrupt the design.</p>

            <center><h2>Javascript</h2></center>

            <center><h2>ReactJs</h2></center>
            <p>React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way reactive data flow, which reduces the boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.</p>

            <center><h2>AngularJs</h2></center>
            <p>AngularJS is a popular open-source framework that simplifies web development by creating interactive single-page applications (SPAs). Unlike traditional websites that load new pages for each click, SPAs offer a smoother user experience by updating content on the same page.</p>
